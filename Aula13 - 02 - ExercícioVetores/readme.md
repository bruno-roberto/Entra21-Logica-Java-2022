- Create a java project where the main menu must for each execution of the exercises serve.
    - The program only closes when choosing the EXIT or 0 option.
    - Before ending the execution, thank the user for using the program.
    - Switch cases should not be complex, should call specific methods.
    - Options in the menu.
        1. Create arrays for each primitive type and display their size in the console.
            - Check the details in the DEBUG perspective.
        2. Create initialized arrays for each primitive type and display their size in the console.
            - Verificar os detalhes na perspectiva DEBUG
        3. Create 1 vector of 5 positions, for the user to feed these values.
            - Verificar os detalhes na perspectiva DEBUG
        4. Create a vector with the size informed by the user and then ask the user to inform the respective values.
            - Verificar os detalhes na perspectiva DEBUG
        5. Create an initialized integer array, to loop through:
            - From start to finish.
            - From end to beginning.
            - To display the values.
        6. Create an uninitialized array of integers.
            - Repeat indefinitely until the user answers no to the question.\
                - Would you like to initialize the value of one of the positions between 1 and SIZE?
            - If you answer yes:
                - Capture a position.
                    - Retry capture while index is not valid
            - If you answer no:
                - Exit repeat launches.
                - Display all vector values.
